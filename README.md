# iOS-final!

This is the requested app following this week's classes. It follows the  **Efreitech Winter Camp Final Project** specs and has some more functionalities extended. Its layout is optimised for iPhone 8, I would not recommend viewing it on another device.


## Functionalities++

### Profile

Once logged in, you will have access to a **profile page** which contains your email and password (not hidden) as well as the ability to change both. This profile is a new **custom view** and has its own class and delegate.

### Colouring

The text fields will turn red if they are not filled properly. They will return to their regular white once the error/s has/ve been corrected.

### Error / success messages

Likewise, error and success messages will appear depending on the action that has been attempted and its result. Error messages appear in red, success messages appear in green. They both disappear once the issues have been solved.
